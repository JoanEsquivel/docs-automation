# What is testing?

Software testing is a way to assess the quality of the software and to reduce the risk of software failure in operation.

Testing is a **process** that includes different activites:

* Test Planning
* Test Monitoring & Control
* Test Analysis
* Test Design
* Test Implementation
* Test Execution
* Test Completion

## Common misconceptions

1. Running tests is only one activity (Test Execution) in the process. 
2. Also, testing involves two important aspects:

  * Verification (QA) - Static Testing
  
  * Validation (QC) - Dynamic Testing

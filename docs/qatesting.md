# Quality Assurance, and Testing

Quality Assurance and testing are related concepts, but they are not the same.

There is a main concept called Quality Management, and it includes:

* Quality Assurance
* Quality Control

What is the difference between Quality Assurance(QA), and Quality Control(QC)?

## Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance is a preventive systematic process focused on the adherence to proper processes, in order to provide confidence that the product/service created has the appropriate levels of quality.

Some of the activities related with this process are:
* Prevent a bug
* Plan
* Verify

## Quality Control
It is a reactive process that support the achievement of appropriate quality levels. Some of the activities related with this process are:

* Detect a bug
* Execute
* Validate  

## So, where is testing in this Quality Management ecosystem?

Testing is going to take place in the whole software development life cycle.
We can start testing work products(source code, design documents, models, functional requirements, etc) using **Static Testing Techniques**.
And then, we can use **Dynamic Testing Techniques** to test the application in real time by giving inputs and examining the results or the output value of behavior.
